1. Run `cargo run` from the `server` directoy.
2. Run `npm run dev` from the `client` directory.

Server will send a message to the client (See the browser console).

Client will send exactly the same message to the server. This will cause the client to disconnect (See the terminal where the server is running).

The chat message is not received correctly by the server.
